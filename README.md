# Simple OBS Countdown Timer

I created this for a friend during the pandemic. He wanted a countdown timer to display in OBS when streaming his church services. 

The problem is that all the timers he found forced you to specify a specific amount of time (ie: 15 minutes). He wanted a timer that would count down to a specific time (ie: 9AM). He couldn't find anything that met his needs. 

So in typical developer fashion I decided that more code was clearly the answer. Huzzah! I present you with the "Simple OBS Countdown Timer". This was written in Flutter Web and is hosted here: 

Basically just set your end time and the timer begins. There's also some options for changing the font and selecting whether you're using chroma key or luna key to remove the background.
